# CNN-model-for-security-analysis-of-power-systems
A CNN model that can analyze power system data fed as matrix input and classify the system in terms of its security status (secure, alarm, or not secure). The model has been trained using the labelled output from this [Monte Carlo Simulation model](https://github.com/IshtiSikder/Monte-carlo-simulation-to-create-data-for-power-systems-security-classification).
